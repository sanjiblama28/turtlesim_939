## 5.1. Trying some of the services provided by service caller

Select the /spawn service where the /clear is seen and can also be used to select other services also and /spawn will help in creating another turtle in the turtlesim window by replacing the digit 0 with another digit and string name also needs to be written and the result can be seen in the response and the turtlesim window.
